## â€¢ List of the tools/library you used && All code for your project with a clear indication of what code you wrote
     Vec2.pde is provided by Dr Stephen J Guy.
     Camera.pde is by Liam Tyler
     
     All other files are written by me.


## Brief write-up explaining difficulties you encountered
     in SPH simulation, the simulating speed is too slow, I set gravity to 1000 and adjust substeps to make it better (but still not realistic)
     Also, the fluid nodes will flicker.
